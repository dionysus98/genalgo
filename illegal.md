## Genetic Algorithm

### standard

1. create a population ., eg: 100 Neural Networks
2. Evalute the fitness of NNs
3. Based on fitness create new populations
   - Pick _parents_ based on fitness scores
   - Crossover
   - Mutation

### Project specific

1. genotype vs phenotype
2. Fitness function ??
